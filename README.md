Weather Dashboard is an application used to display current and forecasted weather conditions for a city selected by the user. When the user enters a city, if the city is valid, the current weather conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, and UV Index) along with the current date will be displayed to the right. Just beneath the current weather conditions, will be a 5 day forecast of the anticipated temperature and wind speeds. 
The Weather Dashboard also stores previously searched cities in local storage to allow for quick access in a new session. If a user enters a city that has already been previously searched, the city's weather information will be displayed without adding a duplicate city entry into the user's search list. The Weather Dashboard will also automatically captilize the initial letter of the city and maintain the remainder of the city's name in lowercase letters to provide better readability for the user.
